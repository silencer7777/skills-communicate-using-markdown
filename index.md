# The Start of a New Era 

<p> My name is Brett. Welcome to my second website project. I've recently completed the skills-communicate-using-markdown tutorial through Github.
This is a fun milestone for me, in my coding/web-development journey and I feel happy and accomplished.
I look foward to future updates and further work on this project.</p>
